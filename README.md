# Getting started / usage

See [docs][10]

Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.x or 0.12.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.13 (to build the provider plugin)
- [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/pricing/)

# Using the provider

To use the provider run `make install` in the root direcory to install it as a plugin. You can then run `terraform init` to initialize it.

# Developing the provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine. You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/SumoLogic/sumologic-terraform-provider`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/SumoLogic;
$ cd $GOPATH/src/SumoLogic
$ git clone git@github.com:SumoLogic/sumologic-terraform-provider.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider. To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/SumoLogic/sumologic-terraform-provider
$ make build
```

# Testing the provider

In order to test the provider, you can run `make test`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests *create real resources*, and often cost money to run. The environment variables `SUMOLOGIC_ACCESSID`, `SUMOLOGIC_ACCESSKEY`, and `SUMOLOGIC_ENVIRONMENT` must also be set for acceptance tests to work properly.
